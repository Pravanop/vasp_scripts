Step 1: Prepare POSCAR file (strongly suggest to use the unrelaxed structure downloaded from the crystallography database);  

Step 2: Run vaspkit with task 302 to get kpath for bulk structure;; 

Step 3: Copy PRIMCELL.vasp to POSCAR; 
Warnning: Note that the vacuum slab is re-oriented to x or y direction for some orthorhombic crystal systems. If so, please do not copy PRIMCELL.vasp to POSCAR;

Step 4: Perform structural relaxation and static calculations;

Step 5: Copy KPATH.in to KPOINTS and perfrom band-structure calculation.

* If you want to run this module under Command-Line Mode, just type the command "vaspkit -task 302 -symprec 1E-5" on the terminal, where the parameter symprec controls the tolerance for symmetry finding.
